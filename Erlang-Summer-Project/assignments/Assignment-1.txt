Assignment:
 
Your manager gives you a bunch of data with cities and their current temperatures in celcius. He wants to go on vacation and needs your help to
decide on the location. He wants to go to cool places with temperatures between 25 and 35 degree celcius, 25 and 35 included. Assume the data 
provided is bound to the Temperature_data variable.
 
Your codes will be tested against some other data. Example test data for you to use and test with:
 
Temperature_data = [{bangalore, 35}, {chennai, 40}, {dehradun, 25}, {delhi, 45}, {vizag, 33}, {ooty, 26}, {suratkal, 41}].
 
(i) Write a List Comprehension expression to get a list of all cool cities. Use the Temperature_data variable.
Example: Your expression should return the following list for the given test data:
[bangalore, dehradun, vizag, ooty].
 
(ii) Write a function is_cool_temp/1 which takes a tuple as an argument and returns true with the cities name if the temperature given is cool, false if not.
Example: 
Tupl = {bangalore, 35}.
is_cool_temp(Tupl).
==> {bangalore, true}
is_cool_temp({delhi, 45}).
==> {delhi, false}
 
(iii) Given a variable
Temperature_boolean_data = [ is_cool_temp(X) || X <- Temperature_data ].
Now write a List Comprehension expression which uses this variable Temperature_boolean_data to give us a list of all cool cities, that is,
the SAME output as the (i) question.
 
(iv) Write a to_fahrenheit/1 function which takes an integer argument as celcius and converts it to fahrenheit value. 
Example:
to_fahrenheit(37). 
==> 98.6
 
(v) Using your to_fahrenheit function, write a List Comprehension expression which, using the Temperature_data variable returns a list
of all cool cities along with their fahrenheit value. 
Example: Your expression should return the following list for the given test data:
[{bangalore, 95.0}, {dehradun, 104.0}, {vizag, 91.4}, {ooty, 78.8}].
 
 
Happy coding!
